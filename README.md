# cs50
Here I will keep all the codes that I write while taking Harvard's cs50 course.
Some of them should also be stored in https://ide.cs50.io/juzalt/ide50 

This also includes any codes that are not directly related to the course but that I learned while taking it.
Ex: I created this repository from Ubuntu's Terminal and I played around with it from there to understand how it works, so probably there will be some nonsense laying around.
